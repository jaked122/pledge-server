Pledgeserver is a project for learning how to write a good database based web-server. In general, it has already surpassed
the level of complexity needed to make it exceedingly flexible when used for any given website. However, it was coded
for a fraternity, by a newly initiated brother who is webmaster, so the current functionality is mostly based around supporting the sort
of things that you might imagine a fraternity would want on a website, E.G. begging for funds, membership page, maybe some
short bios for whatever.
